# Spotify-Music
Exploring the ins and outs of my taste in music on Spotify.

In this project we will be looking at the extended streaming history from my Spotify account. This contains track information from all the songs I have listened to since the creation of my Spotify account. We will explore what genres of music I am in, what songs I am obsessed with, and what seem like outliers of songs.
